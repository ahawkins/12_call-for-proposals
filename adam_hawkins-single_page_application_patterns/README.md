# Single Page Application Patterns

Writing complex Javascript applications comes with a unique set
problems. We've run up into many different ones. Through our successes
and failures we've come up with a set of patterns. These are not
specific to our application but are when you're building a certain
class of application. You don't need if you're building Todos. I'll
present patterns used in Javascript and things you can do from the API
perspective to make developing easier and more testable. These cover
topics such as DOM manipulation, resource separation, data loading,
testing, caching, and bootstrapping.

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
