# Blowing Up Ember(-Data)

Once upon a time I saw Ember and Ember-Data. I thought to myself: this
is great! I'll just load all my data into the client and voilla, instant
performance. I was so wrong. Just so very wrong. Ember-Data has its
limits. Once you have the data, then ember itself has its own limits.
No one knows exactly how much these frameworks can handle. People
casually throw around "a lot" but that's not quantifiable. I put ember
and ember-data through its paces to find how exactly what its limits
are.

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
