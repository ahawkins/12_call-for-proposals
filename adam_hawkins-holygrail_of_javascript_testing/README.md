# Javascript Testing: The Holy Grail

There is a holy grail for Javascript developers: Getting a test suite up
and running fast and have multiple browsers execute the tests. Getting
the holy grail is damn hard. Look how much work Indiana Jones had to get
it--and he didn't even have program! There are barriers to entries
everywhere. How is it easy to get going testing small parts of
Javascript functionality. What happens as your become bigger and more
complex? What about headless testing? Does this process scale up to CI?
Can I even do this stuff locally? There are a myriad of testing tools
and solutions. I'll show you what's out there and what we as a community
need to do next to get to the Holy Grail to ensure a better web
experience for everyone.

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
