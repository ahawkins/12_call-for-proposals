# JSON API's

This talk is all about JSON API's. Its main focus is on how to
properlly generate JSON as well as test it's output. The talk uses
ActiveModel::Serializers for all the examples. 40% of the talk will be
about constructing JSON. The rest will be about performance
optimizations inside JSON generation and delivering it quickly.

Noteable points:

* JSON generation using ActiveModel::Serializers
* Fast JSON generation and performance tips
* Caching inside AMS
* HTTP caching for individual resources and collections
* Pagination with AMS
* CORS support
