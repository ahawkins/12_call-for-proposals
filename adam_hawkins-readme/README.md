Here is my current roster of talks I give. I've given some before,
some I haven't.  All the content comes from (mostly) work and
personal experiences. I'm always looking for chances to talk so
check them out!

If you think these talks are good fit for your event then
please DM me @adman65 or email me.


## Adam Hawkins

My name is Adam Hawkins. I'm a rubyist, rails guy, and general
open source nerd. I love to contribute to open source projects I use as
well as write my own. I scratch my own itches through my open source
work. When I'm not coding I travel and enjoy trance in very heavy doses.
