# Syncing Rails

This talk covers the basics in creating a reusable sync service that connects an 
application to various external systems (Google, MS Exchange, others) 
over a standard interface. It describes the processing for making the 
service accessible over HTTP and bundling it inside a Rails application. 
The talk covers the architecture using OOP design patterns, 
requirements, implementations, and use cases.

## Notes

This talk covers a real life use case our company faced. We had a 
tightly coupled exchange sync implementation. It needed to be extracted 
into different parts so it could easily connect to MS Exchange, Google 
and any other external resource we could think of. I've never seen this 
used before so I thought it would be an interesting topic.
